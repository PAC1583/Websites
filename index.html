                <p>
                    Life is just about keep doing, keep learning, keep hoping for a better future.No matter if times are
                    good or difficult, keeping a busy mind will always make life easier and happier! A life with meaning
                    is being surrounded by the peace of nature or the sound of music that inspires our imagination to
                    create and evolve into better human beings.

                        <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                        <p>
                            Emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, has contributed to the
                            increase of the earth's temperature from the mid-20th century. The rise of sea level due to
                            the melting of glaciers in polar regions, more frequent floodings or less predictable
                            weather patterns are some of the consequenses of this problematic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One of my missions to fight against climate change is to make small contributions such as:
                            reduce the use of a car or airplane. Instead use the train, bus or walk if possible. Try to
                            buy local food and avoid as much as possible the consumption of meats and processed food.

                        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sustainabitily means "meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the
                            ability of future generations to meet their needs".
                            In other words, natural resources are limited and their use should as well be limited or
                            find alternative raw
                            materials that exists in abundance on earth. In this way, the present generation will assure
                            that next generations will also have the chance to have access to all what we enjoy
                            nowadays!
                            <br> In order to shift to a more sustainable economy, goverments need to set more stringent
                            laws and corporations should modify their manufacturing processes.
                            Form my end, I can also play a role by applying what is called 3R's: reuse, recycle and
                            reduce. This implies to limit the use plastic materials or packings, recycle materials such
                            as aluminium cans or plastic bottles and avoid buying what is not neccesary.

                        <p>
                            One important aspect of life is to seek a constant balance in our physical and emotional
                            wellness.
                            It is to be said that both are related to each other according to scientists <a
                                href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/connecting-dots.aspx">(see
                                here)</a>. If one suffers then the other will do.
                            Emotional wellness is the ability to sucessfully handle life¬¥s stresses and adapt to change
                            and difficult times<a

                            On the other hand, physical wellness promotes the proper care of our bodies for optimal
                            health and functioning <a

                            <br>
                            A challenge in life is to improve oneself and be a better person. The use of several
                            startegies
                            such as getting quality sleep, reduce stress situations, be mindful or improve social
                            connections. Regarding the physical wellness, it is important to eat a healthy diet, engage
                            in any
                            physical activity and if necessary visit a physician.

                            Knowledge can be acquired from our surroundings: grandparents, nature or books. With

                            we can survive, interact, create, evolve and many more...
